//    Material is the metaphor.\n\n
//    A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion.
//    The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet
//    technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n
//    Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The
//    use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the
//    flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical
//    world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n
//    The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move,
//    interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows
//    seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n
